Have you ever wondered how Netflix delivers your  
favorite shows seamlessly or how Amazon  consistently rolls out new features?
In this video we unpack the world of  DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering.
These concepts might seem confusing at  first, but by the end of this video,  
you’ll understand the differences, the  similarities, and how they work together.
Let’s get started.
We begin with DevOps, coined by Patrick  Debois and Andrew Shafer in 2009.
DevOps is all about bridging the gap between two  
traditionally separate teams  - Development and Operations.
It’s about cultivating a culture where these  two teams are two sides of the same coin,  
working together throughout the  entire software development lifecycle,  
from design through the development  process to production support.
Ever heard of Amazon’s “You  build it, you run it” principle?
That’s DevOps in action.
In this model, teams that build the  software also deploy and maintain it.
This accelerates the delivery of  new features to us, the end-users.
But we should acknowledge that in our dynamic  tech landscape, roles often blend and evolve.
Effective operators adapt and incorporate  elements from various domains.
A cloud engineer bootstrapping a  virtual instance with Ansible and  
running Kubernetes on top might  look like a DevOps specialist.
Similarly, a sysadmin building tools and utilizing  monitoring system could be considered an SRE.
These lines are fluid. It is what  makes our industry so exciting.
Which brings us to SRE, or  Site Reliability Engineering.
A brainchild of Google, SRE is about building  resilience into large, complex systems.
They developed practices and tools, like  Borg cluster management system and Monarch  
monitoring system, to ensure that software  can handle the stress of real-world demands.
Think of them as the civil engineers of software.
They ensure the software is robustly built,  
functions as designed, and can  efficiently handle traffic.
But unlike traditional operation teams, SREs use  
software engineering approaches  to solve operational problems.
Their goal? To create ultra-scalable  and highly reliable software systems.
But wait, SREs wear many hats too!
They sometimes build tools to  simplify processes for developers,  
stepping into the territory  of a Platform Engineer.
So, what exactly is Platform Engineering?
What does it look like in action?
A great example is Netflix.
Netflix is well known for its  cutting edge infrastructure.
A key player to this is its  Platform Engineering team.
They develop a solid, reliable platform that  
enables developers to produce  high-quality software quickly.
But it’s not just about the technology.
It’s about aligning the entire lifecycle  
of product development with  broader business objectives.
Imagine a system that takes  care of the nuts and bolts.
It allows developers to focus on crafting  those features that keep us binge-watching.
That’s Platform Engineering in action.
It serves as the connective  tissue and binds the different  
components of software development  and operations into a cohesive unit.
Let’s make one thing clear though.
DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering share  a common vision: to enhance collaboration,  
automation, and efficiency in  software development and operations.
But each plays its unique  role in realizing that vision.
It’s less about sticking to rigid job titles and  
more about professionals adapting  and evolving with the industry.
They can co-exist and should co-exist.
This contributes to a more robust  and efficient tech ecosystem.
